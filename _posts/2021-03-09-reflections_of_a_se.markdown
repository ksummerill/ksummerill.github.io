When I decided to start the engineering course at Flatiron, I knew I was setting myself up for a challenging and personally rewarding ~1.5 years. I happened to be starting a new job at the same time. Then 2020 happened. At the end of it all, I wanted to write a short reflection on the experience.


## Pace yourself
Being a self-paced course, I knew I would need to set a reasonable pace in order to complete the coursework on time. Working with Ann, one of the Ed Coaches, she set up a timeline for the coursework according to the number of hours per week that I would be able to spend in school. That was helpful as a high-level guide. However, as I got further into the course, I discovered that I needed more flexibility in my schedule. Some days I could spend more hours doing school than others, but it all depended on a number of variables: 1) what material I was learning (if it was somewhat familiar to me or completely new/complex, 2) my work schedule, 3) how I felt about how I was doing. For my own mental health, I needed a looser schedule, to allow myself to get "off course" and for that to be okay, knowing that my end goal was to finish by a certain month. This allowed me to feel okay with having days off and days where I spend many hours doing school.

## Set Goals
Related to what I wrote above, I set goals for myself. Looking at a section, I would roughly estimate how long it would take me. I also looked at my work schedule and other things happening in my life. Based on that, I would decide when I could finish that section. Wanting to learn a new concept and understand it well, I tend to go into some deep rabbit holes. Knowing this about myself, I also set some goals around time-boxing my work. This would also apply in scenarios where I felt stuck and needed help. I would work for a while on an issue and call time on myself after spending a reasonable amount of time searching for a solution.

## Give yourself a break
I had to remind myself a lot that what I was doing was hard. It was okay to take a break, to walk away. Often, when I walked away and came back, I pretty quickly found a solution to some problem that was hounding me or was just more motivated and energized to finish what I had started. Give yourself a break. You're doing hard things.
